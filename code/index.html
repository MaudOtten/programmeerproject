	<h1><span>Women in science: </span>where do we find them?</h1>
			<p>This page contains data on women in research, where we can find a gender balance and how this developed over time. 
			Previous data analysis shows a clear educational pipeline for women, having a dominant presence among Bachelor students, 
			slightly less among Master students, but relatively absent in research careers. How might this cohere with more generic 
			indicators of female roles in society and investment in education? Do smaller families or strategically spent money make 
			women persue a career in science?</p>
			<p 	style="font-style: italic">Clicking on a dot in the scatterplot or country in the worldmap will present data for a specific country, showing the percentage
			of female researchers per scientific discipline in purple. The blue bars show the relative amount of researchers in this discipline.</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Throughout the years, the relative amount of female researchers has not drastically changed.</li>
				<li>A high percentage of female researchers is mainly found in Eastern European and Asian countries.</li>
				<li>Medical and social sciences and humanities are predominantly female disciplines and show an increase through the years.</li>
				<li>Women seem to be more dominant in relatively smaller disciplines.</li>
				<li>Expences on education do not seem to correlate with the percentage of female researchers. Birth rate however shows a negative
				correlation in years with a high amount of data.</li></ul>
